#Pattern Lab  Styleguide Template

##Getting started

###Prerequisites:

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) – Dependency Manager for PHP,
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) – The backbone of the framework. Node Package Manager takes care of installing all the dev dependencies,
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) – Bower manages all the front end packages and fetches them for, when we start a new project.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) – Task manager and automation. Gulp is responsible for running all the small tasks like compiling SCSS and Twig templates, starting a web server and automatically reloading browsers.
